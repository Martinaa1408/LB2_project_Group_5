# LAB2_project - von Heijne Method 

This repository contains an implementation of the **Von Heijne statistical method (1986)** for signal peptide cleavage site prediction.  
It provides an interpretable, frequency-based baseline to compare against machine learning classifiers.

---

## **Method Overview**

The method builds a **Position-Specific Weight Matrix (PSWM)** from experimentally validated signal peptide sequences and compares them to background amino acid frequencies (SwissProt).  
Pseudocounts (+1) are added to avoid zero probabilities.  

- **Window size**: 16 amino acids (–13 upstream, +2 downstream of cleavage site)  
- **Background distribution**: SwissProt amino acid frequencies  
- **PSWM**: constructed from positive examples  
- **Scoring**: candidate windows are scored with the PSWM; the maximum score in the N-terminal region is used as prediction  

The log-odds formula for PSWM is:

```math
W_{k,j} = \log \left( \frac{M_{k,j}}{b_k} \right)
```
```math
M_{k,j}: \text{ probability of amino acid } k \text{ at position } j 
```
```math
b_k: \text{ background frequency of amino acid } k
```
```math
W_{k,j}: \text{ log-odds weight}
```

## **Implementation**

All steps are contained in a single notebook: [vonHeijne.ipynb](https://github.com/Martinaa1408/LB2_project_Group_5/blob/main/von_Heijne/vonHeijne.ipynb)

Pipeline:  
1. **Window extraction** from annotated cleavage sites  
2. **Count → PSPM → PSWM** (with pseudocount normalization)  
3. **Sliding window scoring** (scan N-terminal region, keep max score)  
4. **Threshold optimization** on validation set (F1 maximization)  
5. **Testing and cross-validation** with evaluation metrics

## **Evaluation**

Binary classification task:  
- Class 1 = protein with signal peptide  
- Class 0 = protein without signal peptide  

Metrics reported:  
- **Accuracy (ACC):** proportion of correctly classified samples  
- **Precision (PPV):** fraction of predicted positives that are true positives  
- **Recall / Sensitivity:** fraction of actual positives correctly identified  
- **F1-score:** harmonic mean of precision and recall  
- **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC):** balanced measure of binary classification quality (–1 to +1)  

Results are averaged over **5-fold cross-validation**, reported as **mean ± standard error**.
